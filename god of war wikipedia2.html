    <p>Santa Monica Studio has developed all main entries, while Ready at Dawn and

        Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) has published all games except the mobile phone installment, which was published by Sony Pictures Digital. 
        The first seven games make up the Greek era of the franchise. God of War (2005), God of War II (2007) and God of War III (2010) 
        comprise its main trilogy; the first two were released on the PS2 with the third on the PlayStation 3 (PS3). A prequel, Ascension (2013), 
        was also released for the PS3. Other games include Chains of Olympus (2008) and Ghost of Sparta (2010) for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) and Betrayal 
        (2007) for mobile phones that supported the Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME). 
        The Norse era began with the 2018 game God of War, which was released for the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and later Windows in January 2022. 
        It was accompanied by a short prequel, A Call from the Wilds (2018), a text-based game through Facebook Messenger. 
        A sequel, Ragnarök, was released in November 2022 for the PS4 and PlayStation 5 (PS5) and concluded the Norse era, 
        which received an epilogue in the form of an expansion pack titled Valhalla in December 2023; a Windows port of Ragnarök with Valhalla was released in September 2024. </p>

            including several Game of the Year recognitions for the 2005 and 2018 installments. Some games have also been remastered for newer PlayStation platforms. As of November 2023, 
            the franchise has sold an estimated 66+ million games worldwide, and is PlayStation's most profitable first-party brand. 
            Strong sales and support of the series led to the franchise's expansion into other media, such as three comic book series and three novels. 
            A film adaptation of the original installment had been in development but was ultimately canceled; however, a television series adaptation of 
            the Norse era is in development for Amazon Prime Video. Merchandise includes artwork, clothing, toys, and prop replicas, as well as the games' soundtracks, 
            including a heavy metal album, Blood & Metal (2010),
             featuring original music by various bands, who were inspired by the Greek era of the series.</p>
